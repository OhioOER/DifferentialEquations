# A Ximera course on Differential Equations


Short Ximera development notes:

* start a Codespace  (from the green 'Code' button un github.com)
* the first time this takes a few minutes; subsequent starts are much faster
* push the 'SERVE' button in the status bar at the bottom
* the first time this takes several minutes; subsequent runs are typicall much faster
* under 'Ports', select the 'world' icon that appears when hovering over the 'Forwarde Address' http://localhost:2080
* select the link 'content' under the Ximera-picture, and find your course


Optional extra's
* select 'Bake standard PDFs' under the 'Extra' menu in the bottom status bar
* push 'SERVE' again
* You'll get download links for all activities that correctly compile to PDF
* edit XIMERA_REPO and/or XIMERA_URL in scripts/config.txt to publish elsewhere; you'll need proper 'codespace secrets' GPG_KEY and GPG_KEY_ID in your github account.
* as of 10-2024, there are still inconvenient differences between the ximera.osu.edu server and the local testserver in your own Codespace.



Notes:
* the \parts in main.tex have to be corrected
